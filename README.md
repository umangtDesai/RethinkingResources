# RethinkingResources

As part of a class capstone, we wrote a book that could potentially help numerous urban schools implement individual capstone projects. This book's purpose is to level the playing field between students of schools from high income areas and low income areas by giving the students of urban schools opportunities to benefit from skills that capstones help learn (creativity, problem-solving, critical thinking etc).
